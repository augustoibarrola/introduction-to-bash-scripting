This error message is known as the $(ColorBlue 'STDERR') of the command.
Whenever we think these error messages might pop up, we can use
$(ColorGreen '2>') to redirect the message either to the terminal or a 
specified file.

Redirecting $(ColorBlue 'STDERR') to a file works the same as redirecting 
$(ColorBlue 'STDOUT') as a file: we can use either $(ColorGreen '>') or $(ColorGreen '>>') to destructivley
or non-destructivley write to a file.

However, since this is a $(ColorBlue 'STDERR') and not a $(ColorBlue 'STDOUT'), we have to
specify the File Descriptor by appending a 2 to > or >>."

Error messages in Bash Scripts can be undesirable sometimes. 
You can choose to ignore them by redirecting the error message 
to the $(ColorGreen '/dev/null') file. 

$(ColorGreen '/dev/null') is pseudo-device that takes in text and then 
immediately discards it."

The above example can thus be rewritten as: 
$(ColorGreen 'ls --hello 2> /dev/null')"

echo -e "
Further, both $(ColorBlue 'STDOUT') and $(ColorBlue 'STDERR') can be redirected for the same
command or script. For example:
$(ColorGreen 'ls --hello > output.txt 2> error.txt')

$(ColorBlue 'STDOUT') and $(ColorBlue 'STDERR') don't need to be written to different files
necessarily â€“ it's just neater that way. We can easily write 
either or to the same file: 
$(ColorGreen 'ls --hello > output.txt 2> output.txt')"

echo -e "
We can even further refactor the above command to something
shorter: 
$(ColorGreen 'ls --hello > output.txt 2>&1')"
